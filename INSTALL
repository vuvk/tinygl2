Installation:

- Edit makeinclude and change what is needed. You can also look at
src/zfeatures.h to change very specific details (only useful to tune
TinyGL2 to your needs). You can link the examples with either OpenGL, Mesa or TinyGL2.

- Type 'make'. The library 'libTinyGL2.a' is copied into './lib'. The
examples are build in './examples'. Only the directories './lib' and
'./include' are needed to use TinyGL2 from another program.

Installation with CMake:
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make
